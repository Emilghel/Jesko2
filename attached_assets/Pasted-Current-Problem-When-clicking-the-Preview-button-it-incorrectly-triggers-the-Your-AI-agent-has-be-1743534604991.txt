Current Problem:
When clicking the Preview button, it incorrectly triggers the “Your AI agent has been set successfully” message and does not play the selected voice.

This means the Preview button is currently wired into the agent creation or save handler, instead of calling the ElevenLabs voice preview logic directly.

Fix Instructions:
	1.	Separate the Button Logic Completely
– The Preview button must call a dedicated function specifically for voice preview only
– It must not call or reference:
– Any saveAgent(), createAgent(), submitAgent(), or similar function
– Any state update that triggers success messages
– Any backend endpoint for saving agent data
	2.	Correct API Integration – ElevenLabs
– When the Preview button is clicked, send a POST request to ElevenLabs’ TTS endpoint:
https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/{voice_id}
– Use a fixed sample text (e.g. “This is a sample of my voice. Let me know how I sound.”)
– Headers must include your ElevenLabs API key and content-type set to application/json
– Response must return an audio/mpeg stream or file
	3.	Playback Logic
– After receiving the audio response, create or reuse an <audio> element
– Set the audio source to the returned audio stream
– Call .play() on the audio element
– Catch and handle any playback errors (e.g. blocked by browser autoplay policies)
	4.	Suppress Unrelated UI Feedback
– Do not show any toast, modal, or success message related to saving
– Do not update any dashboard state that would indicate the user has created an agent
– Only show optional voice-specific feedback, like a loading spinner or “Playing voice preview…”
	5.	Testing & Confirmation
– Test the Preview button independently
– Confirm that clicking it only plays the voice and never shows the success message
– Confirm no agent is created or saved in the backend after clicking preview

Expected Result:
Clicking the Preview button must only play a sample of the selected voice using ElevenLabs and not affect the agent creation flow in any way. The success message should only appear when a user manually clicks Save in the Basic Settings tab.
