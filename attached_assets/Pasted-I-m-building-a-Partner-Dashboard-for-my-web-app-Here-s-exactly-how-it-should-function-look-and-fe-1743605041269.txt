I‚Äôm building a Partner Dashboard for my web app. Here‚Äôs exactly how it should function, look, and feel:

üîê Access Control
	‚Ä¢	Only admin can create a partner account.
	‚Ä¢	Partners must log in to access the /partner-dashboard route.
	‚Ä¢	Unauthorized users should be redirected to the main site or login page.

üìä Partner Dashboard Features
	1.	Affiliate System

	‚Ä¢	Each partner gets a unique affiliate link they can copy/share.
	‚Ä¢	That link should track traffic, free trial signups, and purchases back to that partner.
	‚Ä¢	Show real-time stats:
	‚Ä¢	Visitors from their link
	‚Ä¢	Number of people on free trial
	‚Ä¢	Number of purchases
	‚Ä¢	Number of active memberships
	‚Ä¢	Users who bought tokens

	2.	Customer Data

	‚Ä¢	Show a table of referred customers:
	‚Ä¢	Name
	‚Ä¢	Phone number
	‚Ä¢	Email
	‚Ä¢	Membership type
	‚Ä¢	Number of coins they have

	3.	Earnings & Withdrawals

	‚Ä¢	Show total earnings from referred clients
	‚Ä¢	Button to request withdrawal of funds
	‚Ä¢	Withdraw options: PayPal and Bitcoin
	‚Ä¢	Include a simple withdrawal form and display payout status (pending, paid)
	‚Ä¢	Add animations for the withdraw flow (subtle glow, coin sounds, smooth modal)

	4.	Traffic Tracking

	‚Ä¢	Show how much traffic has come in through their affiliate link
	‚Ä¢	Display as a graph + number of unique visitors

üé® Design Requirements
	‚Ä¢	Sleek & modern dashboard UI
	‚Ä¢	Responsive layout (desktop + mobile)
	‚Ä¢	Animated buttons with soft glows
	‚Ä¢	Beautiful graphics for icons, charts, and cards
	‚Ä¢	Include light sound effects for buttons or notifications (toggleable)
	‚Ä¢	Use modern fonts, spacing, and shadow effects

üß∞ Tools & Stack
Use whatever stack fits best, but preferably:
	‚Ä¢	Frontend: React + TailwindCSS or Chakra UI
	‚Ä¢	Backend: Node.js or Firebase
	‚Ä¢	Auth: JWT or Firebase Auth
	‚Ä¢	Database: MongoDB or Firestore

Also:
	‚Ä¢	Use animation libraries like Framer Motion for subtle movement
	‚Ä¢	Use chart libraries like Chart.js or Recharts for visual stats

Please generate the folder structure, key backend routes (e.g. /create-partner, /dashboard-data, /withdraw-request), and a React dashboard component with animations and basic dummy data so I can wire it up.
