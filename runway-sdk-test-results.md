# Runway SDK Integration Test Results

## Test 1: Direct SDK Test
**Status:** ✅ Success

The SDK was able to initialize properly and connect to the Runway API. A new task was created with the following details:
- Task ID: `999613da-d49f-4121-ad9d-ef2860954642`
- Model: `gen4_turbo`
- Status: Started processing successfully

## Test 2: API Endpoint Test
**Status:** ✅ Success

The API endpoint `/api/image-to-video` successfully:
1. Received the uploaded image
2. Processed request parameters
3. Called the SDK integration module
4. Created a video generation task on Runway servers
5. Task ID: `9f4814b8-fd81-4371-99f8-d647f02dd9cd`
6. Began polling for task completion

## Validation Results

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| SDK Installation | ✅ | Successfully installed and imported |
| API Authentication | ✅ | Using API key correctly |
| Parameter Handling | ✅ | All parameters correctly processed and passed to SDK |
| API Version Handling | ✅ | No more "Invalid API Version" errors - SDK handles versioning |
| Task Creation | ✅ | Tasks successfully created on Runway servers |
| Error Handling | ✅ | Added proper error handling throughout the integration |
| Type Safety | ✅ | Added proper TypeScript types for all parameters and returns |

## Next Steps

1. **Long-Running Tasks**
   - Implement a more robust task polling mechanism with timeouts
   - Add ability to check task status later if generation takes too long

2. **Frontend Integration**
   - Test integration with frontend components
   - Add progress indicators for tasks in progress

3. **Interpolate Support**
   - Monitor SDK updates for interpolate endpoint support
   - Currently using legacy API for interpolate until SDK support is added
