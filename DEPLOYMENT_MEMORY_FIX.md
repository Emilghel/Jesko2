# Deployment Memory Fix

This guide explains how to fix the issue where the deployment gets stuck during the bundling process due to memory limitations.

## The Problem

The project is large and complex with many dependencies, causing the bundling process to require more memory than is available by default. This results in the deployment process getting stuck at the bundling stage.

## Solution: Use Enhanced Build Scripts

We've created two build scripts that allocate more memory to the Node.js process during the build:

1. `build-with-more-memory.js` - A JavaScript build script
2. `deploy-build.sh` - A bash script for deployment

## How to Use for Deployment

### Option 1: Update Render Deployment

1. Log in to your Render dashboard
2. Navigate to your Jesko2 service
3. Go to Settings
4. Under the "Build Command", replace:
   ```
   npm install && npm run build
   ```
   With:
   ```
   npm install && chmod +x ./deploy-build.sh && ./deploy-build.sh
   ```
5. Click "Save Changes"
6. Trigger a manual deployment

### Option 2: Run the Enhanced Build Locally

If you want to test the build process locally before deploying:

```bash
# Make sure the script is executable
chmod +x ./deploy-build.sh

# Run the build script
./deploy-build.sh

# Or use the JavaScript version
node build-with-more-memory.js
```

## Verifying Memory Usage

The bash script will display memory information before and after the build process, which can help diagnose whether memory is the limiting factor.

## Additional Optimization Tips

If the memory increase doesn't solve the issue completely, consider:

1. Code splitting - Split your application into smaller chunks using dynamic imports
2. Tree shaking - Ensure unused code is being removed during the build process
3. Lazy loading - Load components and libraries only when needed
4. Reducing dependencies - Review and remove unnecessary dependencies
