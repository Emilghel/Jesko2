# Runway SDK Integration Summary

## What we've accomplished

1. **Implemented Official Runway SDK**
   - Replaced custom API code with official `@runwayml/sdk` package
   - Fixed "Invalid API Version" errors by letting SDK handle versioning
   - Added proper type definitions for all SDK parameters and responses

2. **Enhanced Type Safety**
   - Created proper type definitions for AspectRatio and RunwayModelVersion
   - Fixed TypeScript errors in the fetch calls with proper type casting
   - Ensured duration parameter is properly constrained to 5 or 10 seconds

3. **Added Robust Error Handling**
   - Better error messages with proper error type checking
   - Improved logging throughout the SDK integration code
   - Added fallbacks for error conditions

4. **Created Placeholder for Interpolate Endpoint**
   - Added stub implementation for the interpolate endpoint using the SDK
   - Set up proper path for implementation once SDK supports this feature

5. **Updated API Routes**
   - Modified server routes to use the new SDK integration
   - Fixed parameter handling to match SDK expectations

## Benefits of SDK Approach

1. **Future Compatibility**
   - The SDK will be updated by Runway to maintain compatibility with their API
   - Less maintenance burden on our side

2. **Reliable Version Management**
   - No more "Invalid API Version" errors as the SDK handles API versions internally
   - Reduced need for custom version headers

3. **Type Safety**
   - Strongly typed parameters and responses
   - Easier to identify errors at compile time

4. **Cleaner Code**
   - Reduced boilerplate code for API calls
   - More maintainable codebase

## What's Next

1. **Testing**
   - Complete end-to-end testing of video generation
   - Verify SDK behavior under various edge cases

2. **Handling Long-Running Tasks**
   - Implement a robust system for checking task status
   - Add ability for users to check status of pending tasks

3. **Interpolate Implementation**
   - Once SDK supports interpolation, update our implementation
   - For now, we'll continue using the legacy API for interpolation

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Monitor API usage and response times
   - Optimize where needed for better user experience
